Completely local data-management platform with built in trainable recommendation engine.  
**Status:** Active Development.  

The core idea is to create a self-hosted local-first system where you rate your data, and the system trains a personal model to understand your tastes. This model then sorts new data based on your predicted interest, creating a personalized filter for any type of data you have — images, music, videos, articles, and more.

*   **Local First:** All data always stays only on your device. All models are trained and inferenced locally.
*   **AI Powered:** Uses advanced embeddings (CLAP, SigLIP, Jina) to understand, search and filter your content and estimate preferences.
*   **FullStack:** Built with Flask, Bulma, Transformers, and PyTorch.
